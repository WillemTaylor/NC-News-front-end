# NC-News (Front-end)

A fully functioning project used in the Northcoders News sprint, including user stories, styling and error handling methods to catch any user errors, resulting in a fluid and engaging experience for users. The app was written in ReactJS and CSS.

## Getting Started

The sprint will be forked into your own repository on Github, and then cloned onto your local machine:
Once done, in terminal;

```
git clone 'github repo url'
```

`cd` into the repository

## Installing

First of all, you'll need to create React app, to get set up within React:
npm i create-react-app "desired name for app"

You'll also need to install the following packages to your local machine:
npm i @reach/router
npm i moment
npm i axios

Within your package.json file, you'll see the following scripts:

```
"start": "react-scripts start"
```

`npm start` runs the newly created app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

## Deployment

Once the app is ready to deploy, you can use
`npm run build`
This will correctly bundle React in production mode and optimize the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
The app is was deployed via Netlify and given the following URL:
